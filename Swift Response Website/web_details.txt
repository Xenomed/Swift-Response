Important points 
1.link commonstyles.css to every new file and make also a new individual css file for it 
like index.html is a new file u created  then link it to commonstyles.css and create index.css for it
2.just copy nav bar and footer properly and rem all the content in a div with some class name so u should have that div inside which is the navbar main con and footer etc 
3.also link the index.js file otherwise the loader wont work
